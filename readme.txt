Hiver is a mod loader for Shrek 2, designed to make loading mods and maps as easy as possible. It integrates perfectly with the game, requiring no additional set-up past dragging and dropping a set of folders on top of your game, and can also be easily configured.

Hiver contains a scripting language called HiverScript, and it allows modders to make simple script mods for the game. When you learn the language, you can simply register a mod, point it to your script mod, and it'll execute in real-time! While HiverScript is always evolving over time, it's surprisingly powerful. Feel free to look over the documentation for it if you're interested.

Hiver supports 2 kind of mods; UnrealScript mods, and HiverScripts. UnrealScript is what Hiver was built on, and HiverScript is what Hiver offers to the more casual modding audience. Although both have their strengths and weaknesses, I'd recommend learning both if you want to get serious about modding.

If you are a modder who has developed a mod for Hiver, adding support is essentially as easy as making a configuration mod for your mod to tell Hiver how to treat it, and it will load effortlessly. Check the documentation provided.

How to install Hiver:
1. Open the provided "Install" folder, then drag-and-drop the folders seen there on top of your game directory (it should replace a file when doing this).
2. Done! You'll know if it worked since a new logo movie will play on start up! To un-install the mod, repeat Step 1, but open the "Uninstall" folder instead.

How to install a Hiver Mod:
1. (depending on mod, this may not be required) Drag-and-drop the folder(s) specified by the mod author on top of your game directory.
2. Rename the "Mod" file in the downloaded mod to include an incremental number at the end. For instance, if you have 2 mods installed (named "Mod0" and "Mod1"), then you'd name it "Mod2".


Features:
 - A modern and painless mod loader
 - A scripting language embedded within Hiver itself for easy modding
